Explanation:
Project Root Directory:

manage.py: The command-line utility for Django.
LibraryManagement/: Contains the core settings, URLs, and WSGI configuration for the project.
templates/: Contains shared templates such as base.html for consistent layout.
static/: Contains shared static files (CSS, JS, images) used across the entire project.
apps/:

This directory contains different Django applications within the project. Each application handles a specific part of the library management system (e.g., books, members, loans).
Each app has its own models, views, templates, and static files.
App Structure:

Each app (books, members, loans) has a similar structure:
admin.py: Admin site configuration for the app.
apps.py: App configuration.
models.py: Database models for the app.
tests.py: Test cases for the app.
urls.py: URL routing for the app.
views.py: Views for the app.
templates/: Templates specific to the app.
static/: Static files specific to the app.
requirements.txt:

Lists all the Python packages required for the project.
README.md:

Provides an overview and instructions for the project.
Design Patterns:
Modular Structure:

The project is divided into multiple apps (e.g., books, members, loans), making it easier to manage and scale.
Template Inheritance:

base.html serves as a base template, which can be extended by other templates to ensure a consistent look and feel.
DRY Principle:

By keeping common static files and base templates in a central location, the project avoids redundancy.
Single Responsibility Principle:

Each app within the project has a specific responsibility, making the codebase easier to understand and maintain.
Separation of Concerns:

Models, views, and templates are separated within each app, adhering to Django's MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture.
This structure ensures that the project remains maintainable, scalable, and easy to understand as it grows.
